# Data-handling
Scenario


You work for an educational technology company that developed an application to help teachers automatically grade assignments. The application handles a wide range of data that it collects from academic institutions, instructors, parents, and students.

Your team was alerted to a data leak of internal business plans on social media. An investigation by the team discovered that an employee accidentally shared those confidential documents with a customer. An audit into the leak is underway to determine how similar incidents can be avoided.

A supervisor provided you with information regarding the leak. It appears that the principle of least privilege was not observed by employees at the company during a sales meeting. You have been asked to analyze the situation and find ways to prevent it from happening again.

First, you'll need to evaluate details about the incident. Then, you'll review the controls in place to prevent data leaks. Next, you'll identify ways to improve information privacy at the company. Finally, you'll justify why you think your recommendations will make data handling at the company more secure.

Solution


Issues

Many people neglected to keep the confidential information private. The manager should have done a better job keeping track of the internal folder by limiting access to the representative and themselves. The customer also could have done a better job of communicating their plans to share the marketing information before posting it to social media.

Review

NIST SP 800-53 is a resource that's designed to help organizations address data privacy risks. The document defines security controls, describes implementation strategies, and suggests individual control enhancements. AC-6 is a section about access controls that relate to the principle of least privilege.

Recommendation(s)

Based on the suggestion of NIST SP 800-53: AC-6, the data leak might have been avoided with the following controls:

Automatically revoke access to information after a period of time.

Regularly audit user privileges.

Justification
Automating security tasks whenever possible is a good way to reduce the chances of human error. In this case, creating a policy that sets expiration dates for access links might have avoided the leak. Requiring managers to regularly audit who can access their files is another way that information could be kept private.
